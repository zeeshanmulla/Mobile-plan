Locking Unlocking system for mobile remote plan
This chapter gives a basic overview about the topic we have implemented. 

LOCKING UNLOCKING SYSTEM FOR MOBILE REMOTE PLAN

LOCKING UNLOCKING SYSTEM FOR MOBILE REMOTE PLAN is something which disconnects the service provided by the network, if payment of bill is not being done time to time. The post-paid mobile phone is a mobile phone for which service is provided by a prior arrangement with a (CSP) Carriage Service Provider. The user in this situation is billed after the fact according to their use of mobile services at the end of each month. Typically, the customer's contract specifies a limit or "allowance" of minutes, text messages etc., and the customer will be billed at a flat rate for any usage equal to or less than that allowance. Any usage above that limit incurs extra charges. 
Theoretically, a user in this situation has no limit on use of mobile services and, as a consequence, unlimited credit. This service is better for people with a secured income. If your mobile calling line is temporarily disconnected, all bills due as at date should be settled in full. The undue bill balance on your account should be less than your credit limit, and needs to be settled on the due date. If the connection is required immediately the payment should be made in cash or credit card. If the line is deactivated you are required to produce your NIC for reconnection.
Mobile phones have grown to be ubiquitous in the past few years. They have evolved from merely luxuries that a rich businessman can afford to necessities that even school-aged children need. Mobile phones provide several comforts, such as security and convenience. However, there is also a cost to owning a mobile phone.
To a cost-conscious individual, this can be easily controlled. Simply try to monitor and limit the number of calls and text messages you make in one day, so you can stay within your allocation. However, what if you run a business, and you're afraid your employees might abuse their company-issued phones. If you get surprised at the end of each month how big yours cellular phone bill is. If you are just a light user and monthly plans give too many free minutes and text messages than necessary.
One good solution is to convert your phone to prepaid. Prepaid systems, or pay-as-you go systems don't have regular, recurring bills. Instead, you buy credits to top-up your phone's "wallet." Each call, SMS or data access is then billed against this amount. This can be particularly convenient if you are a light user. You can keep your phone in your purse for emergencies, but don't have to worry about paying every month for something you aren't using.

1.2	OBJECTIVES

Promotional deals. Often networks give away free Sim cards, these can come with free texts or calls. Yet if your phone isn't unlocked you can't put the Sims in your phone and take advantage. Any decent free Sim offers are included in the free weekly Money Saving  email.
A cheaper tariff. If you like your phone but don't have a good deal, unlocking it allows you to keep the phone but switch to another network. And the fact you don't need a new phone should enable you to get a better tariff. See Cheap Mobiles for more info.
Added value. Unlocked phones sell for more on eBay, because they have much wider appeal to users on other networks and in other countries.
Freedom to roam. Unlocking extends to many foreign Sim cards too, so you can totally eschew the UK networks' expensive overseas rates by getting a local Sim card everywhere you go. See Cheap Roaming for more.
 
 WHY MOBILE COMPANIES LOCK SERVICES OF PHONE
Mobile companies say their phones are already heavily subsidised to entice you to buy them and they need to make up this shortfall. Yet the reality, as ever, comes down to cold hard cash; it makes no sense to sell you the phone at reduced cost and then let you take your money to another network provide
Unlocking is totally legal. It just means making the phone work with any Sim card.
Unblocking is illegal. This is the practice of making a phone work again after it's been blocked by the networks, usually as a result of its being reported lost or stolen. Unsurprisingly, It is thoroughly illegal and should not be attempted.
The post-paid mobile phone is a mobile phone for which service is provided by a prior arrangement with a carriage service provider (CSP). The user in this situation is billed after the fact according to their use of mobile services at the end of each month. Typically, the customer's contract specifies a limit or "allowance" of minutes, text messages etc., and the customer will be billed at a flat rate for any usage equal to or less than that allowance. Any usage above that limit incurs extra charges. Theoretically, a user in this situation has no limit on use of mobile services and, as a consequence, unlimited credit. This service is better for people with a secured income.
Postpaid service mobile phone typically requires two essential components in order to make the 'post-usage' model viable:
Credit history/Contractual commitment: This is the basis on which the service provider is able to trust the customer with paying their bill when its due and to have legal resource in case of non-payment
Service tenure: Most postpaid providers require customers to sign long term (1-3 year) contracts committing to use of the service. Failure to complete the term would make the customer liable for early terminiation fees.
The bill itself is an important component of the services which acts as an ambassador of the service provider and at times as an evidence of the service itself. The bill needs to be readable, comprehensible as well as aesthetically attractive for the subscriber to be interested enough to see details other than the bill amount.
The United States is an example of a country dominated by postpaid providers (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-mobile) although a smaller market has been captured by prepaid providers such as Boost, Virgin Mobile, MetroPCS, Cricket, Tracfone and Jump, many of which use the postpaid providers networks (e.g. MetroPCS is carried on the T-Mobile network).
The alternative billing method is a prepaid mobile phone where a user pays in advance for credit which is then consumed by use of the mobile phone service.

3.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Project Handling Challenges:
The user using this software should perfectly use it as it is software for activating and deactivating the services of the cell phone. Any wrong action can result in inconvenience to the subscriber.

Service Handling Challenges:
The service provider should carefully note the payment status of the subscriber as  any wrong action in the software can result in deactivation of service of a subscriber whose payment has been done.

3.2 SCOPE & PROPOSED SYSTEM
   
Deactivating and activating mobile services instantly from a remote location.
Ability to deactivate services when bill is unpaid with grace period.
Ability to activate services when bill is paid with charged fine.

In proposed system we overcome on existing system. Our proposed system handles all the process of locking and unlocking of mobile services in automated way.

3.3 FEATURES OF PROJECT

It can be used as a HTML editor.
This project is based on the concept of AI.
This system is designed such that the basic requirements of the user & service provider is fulfilled.
Disables services provided by network to customers, in case of bill payment failure in time span.
This Microsoft Office Excel stores each and every contact no with its details like i.e. date, time, duration, and balance left in after disconnecting the call.
Services gets disconnected automatically if  the payment not made till a particular period of time, and services are unlocked or starts for that user after payment have been done.
